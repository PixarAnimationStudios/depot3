module D3

  ###
  ### This mixin module provides attributes and methods for
  ### dealing with d3 basenames, i.e. package families.
  ### It's used by the {D3::Package}, {D3::Client::Receipt}, and {D3::Client::PendingPuppy} classes.
  ###
  module Basename
    include Comparable

    ### The status of D3::Package & D3::Client::Receipt objects, and the integers stored
    ### in the DB for each D3::Package
    ###
    ###  - :unsaved
    ###      D3::Package: a Ruby object that hasn't yet been created  on the server
    ###      D3::Client::Receipt: a Ruby object that hasn't yet been saved to the local
    ###        receipt datastore
    ###
    ###  - :pilot
    ###      D3::Package: on the server, but not yet been made live,1
    ###      D3::Client::Receipt: installed when the pkg was in that state.
    ###
    ###  - :live
    ###      D3::Package: the currently active pkg for a given basename,
    ###      D3::Client::Receipt: the matching pkg is current live on the server
    ###
    ###  - :deprecated
    ###      D3::Package: was once live, now superseded by a new version, but
    ###        still on the server
    ###      D3::Client::Receipt: the rcpt is older than the currently live pkg &
    ###        will be upgraded at sync unless it was installed as a pilot
    ###
    ###  - :skipped
    ###      D3::Package: never made live, but older than the current live
    ###        installer, still on the server, probably should be deleted
    ###
    ###  - :missing
    ###      D3::Package: the data is in the D3 Packages table, but the pkg is
    ###        not in the JSS
    ###      D3::Client::Receipt: No matching :pilot, :live, or :deprecated pkg on
    ###        the server
    ###
    ###  - :deleted
    ###      D3::Package: the matching d3 data has been deleted from the server
    ###      D3::Client::Receipt: the matching receipt has been deleted from the client

    ### @return [Symbol] whats the d3 status of this package? One of the values of D3::Basename::STATUSES
    attr_reader :status

    # @return [Symbol] Is this package a .dmg or .pkg?
    attr_reader :package_type

    ### @return [String] a string for matching to the output lines
    ###   of '/bin/ps -A -c -o comm'. If there's a match, this pkg won't be
    ###   installed or uninstalled
    attr_reader :prohibiting_process

    ################# Public Instance Methods #################

    ### While several packages can have the same basename,
    ### the combination of basename, version, and revision
    ### (called the 'edition') must be unique
    ### among the d3 packages.
    ###
    ### @return [String] the basename, version ,and revision of this package, joined with hyphens

    ### expiration should always return an integer, so if it's nil,
    ### return zero. (we assume anything non-nil is an Integer)
    ### due to input validation)
