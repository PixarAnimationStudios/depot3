d3admin is a tool for administering packages in d3, a package/patch
management & deployment tool that enhances the package-handling capabilities
of the Casper Suite from JAMF Software, LLC.

For detailed documentation see:
    http://some/url/here

Important Terms:

- basename:   A word used to identify all packages that install any version of
              the same thing. E.g. 'filemaker' or 'transmogrifier' When a
              basename is used to specify a package, it refers to the currently
              live package for the basename. (see below)

- edition:    A unique identifier for a package or receipt in d3. It is made of
              the basename, version, and revision, joined by dashes.
              E.g. 'transmogrifier-2.2.1-2'
              Editions specify individual packages regardless of their status.

- live:       Each edition has a status: pilot, live, skipped, deprecated, or
              missing. Only one edition per basename can be 'live' a a time.
              When an edition is made live, it's approved for general deployment
              and is the edition installed with 'd3 install <basename>'. It will
              also auto-install on computers in the packages auto-groups, and it
              will auto-update on any computers with older editions of the same
              basename already installed.

- walkthru:   Any action can take the --walkthru option and you'll be prompted
              for targets (if needed) and options.
              Without --walkthru, you must provide all values with command-line
              options. Anything not on the command-line will use a default or
              inherited value, or cause an error if the option was required.

#{USAGE}

When refering to a package on the server, a basename imples the currently live
edition for that basename. Refering to a package by edition specifies an
individual package regardless of status.


=== Actions and their required targets & options ===

  add      Add a new pilot package to d3
             Target = basename unless -w
             Without -w, requires -v, -r, & -s

  edit     Change properties of existing package in d3
             Target = basename or edition unless -w

  live     Make existing pilot package live
             Target = edition unless -w

  delete   Delete an existing package from d3
             Target = basename or edition unless -w

  info     Show details of an package in d3
             Target = basename or edition unless -w

  search   Search for and list packages in d3.
              Target = search text (RegExp matching)
              No target = list all packages unless -w

  report   Report about d3 receipts or puppies on computers.
             Target = basename, or computer name unless -w

  config   Set up server info and default values for d3admin.
             Target = all, jss, db, dist, workspace,
             pkg-id-prefix or display. Defaults to all

             Using 'display' prints out the current admin config settings.

             Runs 'all' automatically on first run.

  help     Show this help. Use -H for extended help.


NOTE: Any action that requires stored passwords will prompt for your
keychain password if your login keychain is currently locked.

=== Options ===

Non-required options for add will use inherited or default values if unspecified.

General:

  -w, --walkthru                     Interactively prompt for all options.
                                       Options provided on the commandline are
                                       ignored. Without -w, anything NOT provided
                                       on the command-line will use a default or
                                       inherited value or will raise an error.

  -a, --auto-confirm                 Don't ask for confirmation before making
                                       changes. For use in automation.
                                       BE VERY CAREFUL

  -H, --help                         Show this help text

  -D, --debug                        Show LOTS of debugging info about whats
                                       happening. If there's a Ruby error,
                                       show the backtrace. Useful when reporting
                                       problems.

Action add:

  -i, --import <name or id>          When the action is 'add', import an existing
                                       JSS package into d3 by display-name or id.
                                       Requires -w or  -v & -r

  -W, --workspace <path>             Folder in which to build .dmgs & .pkgs
                                       default is your home folder.
                                       Preserved between uses of d3admin.

  -I, --no-inherit                   Don't inherit default values from most
                                       recent package with the same basename.

  -s, --source-path <path>             Path to a .pkg, .dmg, or root-folder
                                       from which to build one

  --dmg                          When building from a root folder, build
                                       a .dmg, rather than the default .pkg

  --preserve-owners                  When building .pkgs, keep the ownership of
                                       the pkg-root folder. Default is to let
                                       the OS set ownership to standards based
                                       upon where items are installed.

  -p, --pkg-id <pkgid>               When building .pkgs, the apple package
                                       identifier, e.g. 'com.mycompany.app'
                                       Defaults to a prefix, plus the basename.
                                       The prefix is either the the apple_pkg_id_prefix
                                       setting from the d3admin config, or
                                       '#{D3::Admin::DFT_PKG_ID_PREFIX}'

Action add and edit:

  -v, --version <version>            Version of the thing installed by the
                                       package, e.g. "2.5", "1.1a3".
                                       May not contain a '-', which will be
                                       converted to '_'

                                       been added to d3.

  -n, --package-name <name>          The JSS 'display name' of the package.

                                       the file will be renamed to this.
                                       If the installer is a .pkg bundle, it
                                       will be zipped, and '.zip' appended
                                       automatically when uploaded.
                                       Defaults to <edition>.<pkg_type>
