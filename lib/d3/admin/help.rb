d3admin is a tool for administering packages in d3, a package/patch
management & deployment tool that enhances the package-handling capabilities
of the Casper Suite from JAMF Software, LLC.

For detailed documentation see:
    http://some/url/here

Important Terms:

- basename:   A word used to identify all packages that install any version of the
              same thing. E.g. 'filemaker' or 'transmogrifier' When a basename is
              used to specify a package, it refers to the currently live package for
              the basename. (see below)

- edition:    A unique identifier for a package in d3 made of the package's
              basename, version, and revision, joined by dashes.
              E.g. 'transmogrifier-2.2.1-2' Editions are used to specify
              individual packages regardless of their status.

- live:       The edition of a basename that is currently released for installation.
              Each basename can have only one live edition at a time, and this
              is the edition that is installed with 'd3 install <basename>'.
              Editions in the basename that are older than the live one are
              'deprecated' or 'skipped'. Newer editions are in 'pilot' and
              can be installed on specific machines for testing before being
              made 'live'.

- walkthru:   Any action can take the -w/--walkthru option and you'll be prompted
              for targets and options. Otherwise, default values are used when
              applicable, or errors are raised.


When the target of an action is a basename, the currently live edition of that
basename is used. Editions specify individual packages regardless of status.

#{USAGE}

=== Actions and their required targets & options ===

                     Target = basename unless -w

                     Runs 'all' automatically on first run.

  help         Show this help. Use -H for extended help.



=== Options ===

Non-required options for add will use inherited or default values if unspecified.

General:

  -w, --walkthru                     Interactively prompt for all options.
                                       Options provided on the commandline are
                                       ignored. Without -w, anything NOT provided
                                       on the command-line will use a default or
                                       inherited value or will raise an error.

  -a, --auto-confirm                 Don't ask for confirmation before making
                                       changes. For use in automation.
                                       BE VERY CAREFUL

Action add:

  -i, --import <name or id>          When the action is 'add', import an existing
                                       JSS package into d3 by display-name or id.
                                       Requires -w or  -v & -r

  -W, --workspace <path>             Folder in which to build .dmgs & .pkgs
                                       default is your home folder.
                                       Preserved between uses of d3admin.

  -I, --no-inherit                   Don't inherit default values from most

  -D, --dmg                          When building from a root folder, build
                                       a .dmg, rather than the default .pkg

  --preserve-owners                  When building .pkgs, keep the ownership of
                                       the pkg-root folder. Default is to let
                                       the OS set ownership to standards based
                                       upon where items are installed.

  -p, --pkg-id <pkgid>               When building .pkgs, the apple package
                                       identifier, e.g. 'com.mycompany.app'
                                       Defaults to a prefix, plus the basename.
                                       The prefix is either the the apple_pkg_id_prefix
                                       setting from the d3admin config, or
                                       '#{D3::Admin::DFT_PKG_ID_PREFIX}'

Action add and edit:

                                       the file will be renamed to this.
                                       If the installer is a .pkg bundle, it
                                       will be zipped, and '.zip' appended
                                       automatically when uploaded.
