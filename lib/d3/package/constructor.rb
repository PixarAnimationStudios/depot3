module D3
  class Package < JSS::Package

    ################# Constructor #################

    ###  Existing d3 pkgs are looked up by providing :id, :name,
    ### :basename, :edition, or the combination of
    ### :basename, :version, and :revision (which comprise the edition)
    ###
    ### If passed only a :basename, the currently-live package for that basename
    ###  is used, an exception is raised if no version of the basename is live.
    ###
    ### When creating a new d3 package use :id => :new, as for JSS::Package.
    ### You must provide :name, :basename, :version, and :revision.
    ###
    ### To add a pkg to d3 that's already in the JSS, use {D3::Package.import} (q.v.)
    ###
    ### For new (or imported) packages, you may also provide any of the other
    ###   data keys mentioned in P_FIELDS.keys and they will be applied to the
    ###   new Package. You may also set them after instantiation using their
    ###   respective setter methods. A value for :admin must be set before
    ###   calling {#create}.
