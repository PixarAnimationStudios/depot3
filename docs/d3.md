## NAME

   **d3**  - The client-side tool for the [d3 package/patch management & deployment system](Intro.md)
   
## SYNOPSIS

d3 action [target [...]] [options]

## CONTENTS

## DESCRIPTION

d3 is the client-side tool for working with d3 packages on client computers. It is used to install, test, uninstall, update, list, and otherwise manage packages.  

It can perform two kinds of actions: package & receipt manipulation, or information listing. Each action has a long and short form, for example `d3 install` or `d3 i`

The 'sync' action is the core of d3's automation, and the `d3 sync` command is meant to be automatically executed one or more times per day, usually via a launchd daemon or a Casper policy.

The options can modilfy how an action is performed, or provide addtional information needed for the action. 

All d3 actions must be run as the superuser, because it needs to read secure information for accessing the JSS and its MySQL database.


#### Important vocabulary

Please see [the introduction to d3](Intro.md#basic-vocabulary) for some basic vocabulary fundamental to understanding any discussion of d3.
