# This script is a wrapper around the command `d3 sync`
# for a couple reasons.
#
# 1) It can be installed as a jamf script and run via a policy (tho so can
#   just running the `d3 sync` command itself via a policy). With a custom
#   trigger, and admin-training, using `jamf policy -trigger myd3syncTrigger`
#   to do all syncs will ensure the timestamp is correct even for manual
#   syncs.
#
# 2) After a successful sync, it writes a timestamp into the HostInfo file via the
#   `phi` command (q.v. in this same dir). That timestamp can then be used locally
#   for any desired reason.
#
# This technique can be used for running any command and updating a phi timestamp.

PHI_PATH=/uar/local/bin/phi

# bail if d3 is currently running a sync
ps auxww | grep -v grep | grep "$D3_PATH .* sync" && echo 'd3 is already syncing, exiting.' && exit 0

# run d3 sync quietly
if ! "$D3_PATH" -q sync ; then
  # report failure
